# PTPN22 R620W RNA-seq Analysis (Example Workflow)

This repository contains an example R workflow showing how RNA-seq data would be analysed to study the effects of the PTPN22 R620W variant in synovial fibroblasts.  
The workflow is hypothetical and does not include real sequencing data.


# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how RNA-seq could be used to compare:
- Wild type synovial fibroblasts (WT)
- CRISPR-edited PTPN22 R620W fibroblasts
- PTPN22 knockout fibroblasts

The analysis focuses on:
- Differential gene expression  
- Autophagy and inflammatory pathway enrichment  
- Protein–protein interactions  
- PCA clustering of samples
